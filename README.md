# Implement a Stack in Python using Merge Sort

[ ![Implement a Stack in Python using Merge Sort](./image.png)](https://youtu.be/JKEV5iv1-wY)

This repository contains the code for the implementation of a Stack data structure in Python using the Merge Sort algorithm.

I have a video walkthrough of this challenge available on my [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/JKEV5iv1-wY) and [my blog](https://kalbartal.net/implement-a-stack-in-python-using-merge-sort/).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Operations
The Stack should be able to handle the following operations:
- push
- pop
- peek
- isEmpty

In addition, the Stack should also be sorted in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Usage
To run the code, simply clone the repository and run the main.py file using Python.
